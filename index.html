      <p4>
        I have dabbled in Java, HTML, CSS, JS, and C# for 4 months, 1 semester in High School. 
        <br>
        The only reason I got into all of this was because of my brother, getting me into Roblox
        <br>
        at the age of 5, getting me an account at 6. It is still up to this day with me as it's owner.
        <br>
        The Username to that account is

      ❂ Artist Experience ❂
    </p>
    <div class="noHoverSmall">
      <p4>
        I have been drawing ever since I was 7, and had these skills further improved via diagnosis for my ADHD at 16, 
        <br>
        making digital art, diving into pottery in 2023, but stopped pottery temporairly due to stress, and lack of equipment.

      ❂ Video Editor Experience ❂
    </p>
    <div class="noHoverSmall">
      <p4>
        I made niche video edits of Persona 2 Characters in vines using their sprites in Mobile Capcut ever since
        <br>
        November 7th, 2022, but had recently stopped due to lack of inspiration, and reason below.
        <br>
        <br>
        For 4 months in my 2nd semester for my last year at High School, I have also helped my school's 
        <br>
        TV Journalism Class for video editing relentlessly, as well as tech support when
        <br>
        things weren't working as planned, such as fixing the Prompter 
        <br>
        to display the text for the computer's side and the Prompter's side.

      ❂ Swimming Experience and Schedule ❂
    </p>
    <div class="noHoverSmall">
      <p4>
        I swam ever since I was 8, and stopped for a while, and returned at 15, working out with a
        <br>
        swimming team, changing teams at 17, and ongoing, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6-8pm CST, every week unless an emergency occurs.

      ❂ Musician Experience ❂
    </p>
    <div class="noHoverSmall">
      <p4>
        Lowkey, this one was one that I wasn't too fond of when I was 11. I was a violinist for 1 semester (4 months) and stopped due to
        <br>
        a dislike for reading sheet music and I was really terrible at completing my homework for Orchestra. 
        <br> 
        My teacher was really kind-hearted and I sort of got off the hook.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been addicted to music for a while since then, and specifically music from games.
        <br>
        But recently, I've been also helping someone on producing their music, however it isn't complete as of yet.

    <div class="noHoverSmall">
      <p4>
        Gaming and AniManga are things that had a big amount of impact in my life, and got me to meet the people I am closest to.
        <br>
        Heres some things that I am really interested in, both in Gaming and AniManga, as well as favorite character.
